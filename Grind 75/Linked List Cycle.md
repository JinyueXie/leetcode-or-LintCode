# Description:
 <p> Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.</p> 

**example 1:**
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**
```
The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
```

 ### Solution

```Python
"""
Definition of ListNode
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    """
    @param head: The first node of linked list.
    @return: True if it has a cycle, or false
    """
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        fast, slow = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            if fast == slow:
                return True
            
        return False
    
Time complexity: O(N)  Space complexity: O(1)
