# Description:
 <p> Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. </p> 
**example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

**example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
```

 ### Solution 1

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_length = 0
        
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            
            left_length = dfs(root.left)
            right_length = dfs(root.right)
            self.max_length = max(left_length + right_length, self.max_length)
            return max(left_length, right_length) + 1
        
        dfs(root)
        return self.max_length

Time complexity: O(N)
```
